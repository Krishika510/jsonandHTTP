# jsonandHTTP
This is a revision code of the basic concepts of JSON formatting and HTTP requests in Python.

I am fetching a list of data of user events with their timestamps and pages visited. The task is to format the data and club sessions together.
Each event by a user can vary by 10 minutes. The total session time along with pages visited in that session is returned.
